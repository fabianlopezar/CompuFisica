## Description

**Whack-a-Mole** is a classic arcade game where moles randomly appear in holes, and the player's objective is to "whack" them before they disappear. The more moles you hit, the higher your score. But be careful! Some moles are tricky, and missing too many of them could cost you lives!

The game is designed with a fun, colorful, and interactive interface, and it's an excellent way to test your reflexes and coordination.

## How to Play

1. When the game starts, moles will randomly pop out from holes on the screen.
2. Use your mouse (or touch if playing on a mobile device) to hit the moles by clicking/tapping on them.
3. Each hit increases your score. Be quick! The moles will disappear after a short time.
4. The game ends when you miss a certain number of moles or after a set time limit.
5. Try to get the highest score possible!
